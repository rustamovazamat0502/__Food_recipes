        <h4 class="text-center">What Is the Power of a Cooking Website?</h4>
        <p>
            A cooking website is a web resource that is promoted according to information requests of culinary and
            food
            topics. Besides presenting your services and sharing helpful information on cooking, you can even
            monetize
            your site and get additional money (by contextual advertising, advertising various culinary services,
            affiliate programs and other <a

            marketing strategies</a> ).

            Nevertheless, making a cooking website is not an easy thing. Indeed, at this stage, you not only pledge
            the
            foundation of the entire project but also think about its future activities. Let us briefly consider
            some of
            the steps you need to perform to make a stunning cooking website.

        <h4 class="text-center">How to Create It?</h4>
        <div>
            There are many stages, from the idea of creating a cooking website to its launch. One of them is the
            choice
            of a suitable platform. Before you make a cooking website, you should decide on its requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>what your <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/target-audience/">target audience is;</a></li>
                <li>whether you sell the dishes cooked by yourself, organize a site with recipes or create a
                    forum;
                </li>
                <li>whether each user will be able to post recipes;</li>
                <li>what the general appearance and functionality of the cooking website will be, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            These and many other questions are essential to think about in advance. One of the most convenient and
            easy
            to use engines is MotoCMS visual builder . It is a perfect match for creating a cutting-edge cooking
            website. Among the main advantages of this editor, one can distinguish the presence of many implemented

        <h4 class="text-center">Main Ingredient</h4>
        <div>
            There is a star in every dish you create, be it steak, chicken, potatoes or lettuce. Knowing your star
            ingredient from the beginning helps you to shape your dish. For your web page, the star ingredient is your
            keyword phrase. You will use this keyword phrase to shape your content, just like the recipe for a meal.

            In preparation for writing your web page, you need to know what the keyword phrase is for this individual
            page, and only this page, before you start writing. Determining the optimal keyword phrase is known as
            <a href="https://www.seeme-media.com/starter-guide-keyword-research/">Keyword Research</a>.
            Don’t skip this
            step. If you are not focused on the star ingredient of your page, you may
            end up making content that no one wants, competes with other content on your site, or targets a very
            saturated subject. How many tuna sandwich recipes does the world really need?

            When coming up with your keyword phrase, think about what someone would type into a search engine to find
            your page. Most people type between three and six words in a search phrase, so use that as a guide. Yes,
            keywords can be phrases, like “red onion” or “five-year aged cheddar cheese”, as long as you use them
            consistently in your content. (There is a whole deep dark hole on keyword research that we go into here, but
            for now, let’s keep it simple and assume you know the keyword phrase you have picked is the perfect one!)

            Like with any good recipe, you also need to know how much of your star ingredient you are going to use. Too
            much and you ruin a dish, too little and you can’t taste it. Know what you are writing about and how you
            plan to highlight your keyword phrase before you start. Make sure you don’t go overboard when using your
            keyword phrase. Don’t overuse your keyword phrase and make it hard to read your content; use just enough
            that everyone knows what you are talking about and the content reads in a natural way.

            Simpler recipes are easier to understand, both for chefs and readers. No need to make a 7-course meal here.
            One dish at a time; one topic at a time. By this, I mean to target a single keyword phrase per page you
            create.
